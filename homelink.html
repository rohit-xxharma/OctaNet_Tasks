                    <span>Why people love nature</span></h2>
                <p>Why do people travel? People travel for many reasons and love travel for different reasons too. Some people don’t enjoy travel, but they still have to travel for many reasons. Reasons can involve work, family, health or medical treatment, social or economic needs. People who love to travel enjoy relaxation, new cultures, foreign food or incredible landscapes different to their normal surroundings. Some people enjoy the motion of travelling, being on a boat, plane, train , or bus. Reasons people travel are many and complex.
                <br>
                People often travel because they are inspired to do so by great travel books. To gain a greater understanding of why people travel and the enjoyment that is to be gained from travel, read some of the best, most inspirational travel literature available today. Classical travel books include, Anthony Bourdain’s World Travel, an Irreverent Guide, (our links take you to Amazon) or any of Paul Theroux’s books, The Great Railway Bazaar being a good example, this book covers Europe and Asia. For travel in America try Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods. Buy these as gifts for the travellers you love!
